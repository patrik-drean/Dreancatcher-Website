        <p>

            Lauri is currently a Foot Zone Practitioner helping clients find Emotional, Mental, Physical, and Spiritual balance in their lives through Foot Zones, 
            Guided Imagery, and other powerful modalities. She came into this new energy over 8 years ago, when her youngest child was born. 
            Feeling the need to keep up with a toddler led her to evaluating her diet and how it was affecting her health and energy. 
            She went RAW for 18 months healing her lack of energy, and several bodily ailments that she’d been plagued with. . . 
            Although not totally RAW any more, she still is vegan and enjoys feeding her family healthy meals and treats. 
            Along the way she has added knowledge of Chakras and how they affect our energetic system, finding balance and 
            mental acuity through Kundalini Yoga and other modalities.
            <br /><br />

            Lauri has been married to her hubby for 35 years. They have 7 children. The “Original 6”, as they call themselves, 
            are grown and out of the house and having families of their own. And their surprise package! Is 12 and still at home.

            Hailey and Lauri met in their Foot Zone class at Wellness Life Zone and became instant friends. Despite the age difference. 
            They became study partners to help each other get through class. 😉 But even after they achieved that goal and are 
            Certified Foot Zone Practitioners, they realized they still wanted to hang out and have someone to bounce ideas off of. 
            Now they get together regularly just to laugh and talk and take field trips. They have made Kombucha, Fermented foods, 
            Herbal remedies and much more together.
