    Within each of us is an innate blueprint of wholeness. 
    This blueprint knows “self" in our perfect essence, which is what we call the normal line of health or the ability to thrive.
    <br /><br />
    Every part of us, from the body, right to our atoms and the electromagnetic field, has the formula to this blueprint. 
    Inherent signals in the feet map out this system and we treat the feet as a keyboard, triggering the entire map of the body right to the cellular level.
    <br /><br />
    The practice of a therapeutic Foot Zone is a powerful, yet noninvasive, and simple technique that quickly empowers the blue print of the body 
    to recover something as small as a single cell, to something as large as a system in the body, mental, emotional, and physical energies 
    back to optimum health. (Adapted from WLZ)

    Foot Zone Technique, or a form thereof, has been found and documented around the world and throughout history. 
    It is hard to say where for when foot zoning started because not all civilizations have written records, 
    but through oral traditions this knowledge has been passed down from generation to generation. 
    Egyptian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese and European cultures have left trace clues about their use of triggering signals on the feet to promote health.
    <br /><br />
    Many experts believed that some form of foot zoning began with man’s earliest existence. 
    Man would trigger signals naturally by walking barefooted on rough and rugged ground. 
    Today, because of modern transportation, smooth walkways, and cushioned shoes, 
    these signals are not triggered naturally as often and intensely as they once were.
